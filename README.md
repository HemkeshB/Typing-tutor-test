# Typing-tutor-test

•	Built a console-based typing tutor with Python which actively generates typing tests to improve the user.

•	Initial concept based on Json/python dictionary backend which lacked scalability for future features.

•	Moved to SQLite 3 backend for user details/history along with new word storage for personalized tests.

•	For word database wrote a script transferring words from Json files while adding individual character count.

•	Furthered my SQL knowledge and Python programming.
